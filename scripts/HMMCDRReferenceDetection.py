class CommandLine() :

    Handle the command line, usage and help requests.

    CommandLine uses argparse, now standard in 2.7 and beyond. 
    it implements a standard command line argument parser with various argument options,
    a standard usage and help.

    attributes:
    all arguments received from the commandline using .add_argument will be
    avalable within the .args attribute of object instantiated from CommandLine.
    For example, if myCommandLine is an object of the class, and requiredbool was
    set as an option using add_argument, then myCommandLine.args.requiredbool will
    name that option.
